Series of examples illustrating the feasibility of robust simulation
using enclosure methods.  The examples start first with illustrating
the problems of classical numerical methods using single
fixed-precision floating-point numbers and fixed-size steps.
Difficulties with Zero crossing are pointed out to motivate the need
for enclosure methods.  Issues arising with enclosure methods are then
discussed and progress builds up until we show that we can get good
enclosures for a Zeno system.  The final step is to show how this same
machinary naturally handles uncertainties about model parameters and
initial values.
