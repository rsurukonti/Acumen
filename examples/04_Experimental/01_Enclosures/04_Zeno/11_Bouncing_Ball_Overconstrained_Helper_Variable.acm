// Note:  An additional invariant, based on a helper 
//        variable, makes the post-Zeno enclosure 
//        convergent.
//
// Note:  The helper variable r bounds the total
//        energy of the system in terms of x and x'. 
//        The constraint added based on r is used to 
//        express that energy is lost on each impact 
//        (event).
