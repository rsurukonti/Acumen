// Divergent Loop Example

// Author:  Jan Duracz
// Note:    Run using Semantics -> Enclosure

model Main(simulator) =
initially 
  mode = "one", x = 1 
always
  match mode with [
    "one" ->
      if true then
        mode+ = "one",
        x+ = x/2 // Non-constant reset
      noelse ]

// Note:  In this example, the looping system has 
//        a non-constant reset, which prevents the 
//        reachability analysis from terminating.
// Note:  The set of reachable states after n-1
//        transitions is { 0.5^k | k = 0 .. n-1 }. 
//        Because the n:th transition reaches the 
//        value 0.5^n, which is not in the so far 
//        observed set, the reachability analysis
