These exmaples illustrate how we can use an enclosure 
based solver to simulate systems which exhibit an
infinite number of transitions during simulation.

 - Minimal example of a system that exhibits an 
   infinite number of transitions during simulation.

 - Example with infinite transitions between two modes.

 - Example of a system for which the reachability 
   analysis does not terminate.

 - A variation of the Divergent loop example, where the
   initial state has been modified to include all 
   reachable states of the system. This makes the 
   reachability analysis terminate.
