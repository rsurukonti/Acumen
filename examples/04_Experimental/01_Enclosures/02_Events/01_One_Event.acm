// Note:  It was detected that an event could have 
//        happened at some point during the simulation.
// Note:  The possibility of an event was detected, 
//        but the solver could not prove that 
//        the event *must* have happened. Thus, the 
//        evolution of the system without an event 
//        (below 0) is also enclosed.
// Note:  Mode names, such as "q" in this model, can be
//        chosen arbitrarily.
