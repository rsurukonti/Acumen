These exmaples illustrate how simulator parameters 
affect simulation results. The examples are grouped 
according to the specific simulator parameter they 
illustrate.

 - simulator.minSolverStep
   This parameter is the smallest segment of time 
   over which model ODEs will be solved. For models 
   with constant fields, this can be set equal to the 
   simulation end time. For models with nonconstant 
   fields, setting this to a lower value can shrink 
   the enclosure, at the cost of an increased 
   simulation time. The value of this parameter must 
   be positive.

 - simulator.minLocalizationStep
   This parameter is the smallest segment of time over
   which event localisation will happen. Setting this 
   to a lower value makes it possible to more 
   precisely determine the time at which an event 
   occurred. This can translate to an overall 
   improvement in the size of the enclosure, at the 
   cost of an increased simulation time. The value of 
   this parameter must be less than or equal to 
   minSolverStep.

 - simulator.minComputationImprovement
   This parameter is a measure of the amount of 
   improvement necessary for the algorithm to 
   continue improving the enclosure. A lower value 
   can give a smaller enclosure, at the cost of an 
   increased simulation time. The value of this 
   parameter must be non-negative. Setting this 
   parameter to zero effectively disables it, meaning 
   that the size of enclosures depends on the values 
   of the remaining parameters.
