always
  match mode with [ //

// Note:  It's fast for linear problems.
// Note:  It solves this problem in *one* step.
// Note:  The *entire* enclosure here is thin (unusual).

// Note:  The currently enclosure semantics *requires*
//        that models have a very specific form, in
//        particular, they must always have exactly one 
//        mode, and consist of one big match on that mode.
