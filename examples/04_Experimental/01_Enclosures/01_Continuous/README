The purpose of this series is to give some examples of 
how Acumen's experimental enclosure-based solver can be 
used to construct enclosures for some basic continuous 
systems.

These examples illustrate how we can use an enclosure
based solver to simulate continuous systems. To obtain
good simulation results as fast as possible usually
involves two steps:

  1 Simulate the model with the following parameters
    set to relatively large values:
      - simulator.minSolverStep
      - simulator.minComputationImprovement

  2 Incrementally decrease the parameters until the
    desired enclosure quality is achieved. 

The examples illustrate progressively complex continuous
systems, with parameters set to produce enclosures 
quickly.
