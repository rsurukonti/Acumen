//The simulation case describes the testing vehicle 
//approaching from behind towards the reference object 
//(car/pedestrian). Simulation shows the testing vehicle 
//kinematic maneuver (Smooth steering) when critical distance 
//between testing vehicle and reference stationary 
//object/Vehicle crosses threshold values. Planar 
//differential vehicle was modeled in local reference frame, 
//where the position, orientation, linear velocity and 
//rotational velocity were defined in terms of right and 
//left side wheels. The yaw angle, vertical distance and 
//horizontal distance were used as the control variable for 
//safe maneuver. The local planner position and velocity 
//vectors were then transformed in Global Cartesian 
//Coordinates.  3D visualization of the planar vehicle was 
//represented by rectangular box; the straight road was 
//represented by a fixed rectangular box; the sensor was 
//represented by the single variable which 
//calculate(ideally without uncertainty and faults) the 
//distance between testing vehicle and stationary vehicle. 
//The left and right tire constant velocity was provided to 
//get the velocity and orientation at the center of the 
//vehicle.
