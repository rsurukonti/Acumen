// Note:  Model of Sawtooth Wave implemented as a 
//        hybrid automaton.
// Note:  Claim added in order to make event detection 
//        certain when using the 2013 Enclosure 
//        semantics.
// Note:  The addition of the claim makes it possible 
//        to use = instead of >= in the guard on 
//        line 11.
