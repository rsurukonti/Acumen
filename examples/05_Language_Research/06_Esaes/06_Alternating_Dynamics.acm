// Alternating Dynamics Example

model Main(simulator) =
initially
  a = 0, b = 0, 
  x = -1, x' = 0 
always
  x' = a*x + b, // Single differential equation
  if x > 1 then
    a+ = -1,
    b+ =  0
  noelse,
  if x < 1/2 then
    a+ = 0,
    b+ = 1
  noelse 

// Note: In this example, a single differential equation
//       is used to express the system's dynamics.
//       Alternation is achieved by setting the coefficients
//       of the constant and linear terms.
// Note: This technique can be used to implement match ing with [between
//       any kind of dynamics, as long as the order of the
//       differential equation remains the same between modes.
