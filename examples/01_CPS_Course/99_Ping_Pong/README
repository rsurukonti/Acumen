This is a directory for keeping the latest models of the Acumen ping
pong game, along with its documentation.  We should develop the
documentation in the form of a paper about the model, and an
explanation of how the model is intended to be used.

Note: In the tournament, it seemed that there were some games that
caused other objects to have multiple assignments.  That's actually
the kind of thing that we would like to *verify* cannot happen, or at
least make subject to extensive testing and try to weed out through an
agile process.  In some cases, one of the players bats just disappered
(like Pawanism vs. Falafel).
