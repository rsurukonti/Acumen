The purpose of the 01-10 sequence of examples is to illustrate basic
3D visualization and trigonometric concepts.

The purpose of the 11-19 sequence of examples is to help us get
comfortable with differential equations.  The series starts with x'=1
and goes to x''=-sin(x).  It stimulates a discussion about how
differential equations model interesting behavior and how they can be
solved.  Trivial differential equations can be solved by direct
integration.  Linear equations have elegant special form solutions.
Non-linear equations get a bit more tricky!
