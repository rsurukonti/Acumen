// Square of Self as Second Derivative Example

model Main(simulator) = 
initially
  x = 0,  x' = 1,  x'' = 2
always
  x'' = -x*x/6
 

// Note:  Non-linear equation
// Note:  Solution is not a sum of complex exponentials
// Note:  We can still use the Picard method to
//          construct approximate solutions to non-linear
//          equations
// Note:  Singularity!
