  t   =  0, // Local time
  t'  =  1, // Is as fast as global time

     center=(0,0,0)       // Center point
     size=(0.2,t/2+0.1,3-t/4) // Size        
     color=red 
     rotation=(0,0,0))
 

// Exercises
// 1) Does the box rotate during the animation?
// 2) Display the area of the surface that changes
//    size during the animation
