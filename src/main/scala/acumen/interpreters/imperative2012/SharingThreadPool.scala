/**
 * A work sharing thread pool. Work is scheduled by passing a function to the run
 * method. The function returns a SyncVar which is used to communicate results back
 * to the caller of run. The function that was passed to run is put on a queue,
 * from which worker threads take work items. When a thread completes its work, it
 * writes it to the SyncVar.
 *
 * SharingThreadPool is parametric in a type variable A, this is the result type of
 * the functions that are passed to run and must be the same over all calls to run
 * for a specific instance of SharingThreadPool.
 *
 * The constructor parameter nbThreads is the number of threads in the pool.
